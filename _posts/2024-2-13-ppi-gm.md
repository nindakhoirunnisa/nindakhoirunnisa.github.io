I contributed to the PPI GM website, Indonesian Student Association in Greater Manchester, by developing a new page dedicated to the Indonesian Cultural Festival (ICF) using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Implemented interactive feature and responsive design to enhance user engagement and accessibility.
