Hello, my name is Ninda Khoirunnisa. I'm a highly motivated and results-driven data scientist with a passion for extracting insights from complex datasets to drive informed decision-making. With a Master's degree in [Data Science from the University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/masters/courses/list/11552/msc-data-science-computer-science-data-informatics/), I have acquired a strong foundation in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. 

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities for growth. From predictive modeling to natural language processing, I thrive on leveraging cutting-edge techniques to solve real-world problems. You can see my portfolio [here](/portofolio/), my resume [here](/resume.pdf), or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ninda-khoirunnisa-136225150/).
